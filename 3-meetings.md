# 3. Meetings

## What is the goal of a meeting?

Since the hackerspace is mainly a do-ocracy, there is actually very little that needs to be discussed on a meeting. Do you want something done? Well then, don't talk about it, just do it. Moreover, meetings only have limited power since, even if everyone in the meeting agrees that "A" is something great to do, it will only be done if someone actually does it afterwards.

The goal of our meetings is to build community and keep everybody informed.

## How do we make decisions

Do-ocracy! We do things; if you want the table painted blue and somebody else wants it painted red, then the table gets painted blue because that's the color of paint you bought. If you want to try to make a decision as a group, you're welcome to do so, but even then, the final decision is made by the one doing the work.

Outside of a GA, where binding votes is a legal requirement, we do not have binding votes on proposals. While voting can be a useful tool to make decisions, the results of a vote are not binding. There may also be other, better tools to make the decision.

## Suggestion: How to run the meeting

### 60 seconds

We start out with "the minute", where each member gets 60 seconds with which to do absolutely anything they want. Most members talk about the projects they've been working on, but Alice decides that she wants to poll the members on an idea she has, and Bob uses his time to gather everybody (who wants to take part) for a group photo.

### Practical part

Once everybody has taken their minute, we move on to the practical matters. We need to get new drinks, which Alex volunteers for. Sam announces that they're donating a vacuum to the space to help keep it tidy. Finally, an announcement is made reminding everyone to not leave food trash in the space overnight lest we gain more wireless mice.

### In-depth topics

Jack wants to throw a conference over the weekend, and asks for help running it. Alex agrees that this is a great idea, and offers to find people to give talks. They all agree to meet another day to discuss more, and invite anybody else who is interested to join.

### FIN

At this point, everybody has said their piece, and we close the meeting. It only took 15 minutes.
