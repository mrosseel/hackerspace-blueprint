# 6. Conflict resolution

## How to avoid conflict

### Social behavior

* When in doubt if you're doing the right thing, you probably aren't.
* Share your love and passion, but respect people's boundaries.
* Don't hack people without their explicit consent.

If you have any issues with other people's behavior, please notify the board. The board will help if you want, but even if you don't; still notify them so they know of the problem.

### Noise

People are trying to concentrate in here so:

* Mind your voice, volume. If you are talking to someone on the other side of the space, everyone in between can hear you; move closer.
* We know you like X music, but use headphones or keep the volume low.
* If you need to make a lot of noise, ask if you are not intruding/disturbing.
* Some moments are 'louder' than others, so it's not always easy to follow. Sometimes library/office-rules apply, sometimes workshop-rules and sometimes bar-rules. When in doubt, check with the other members.

### Network/security

* Just leave other people's stuff alone, don't post "funny" social network status updates on unattended logged in computers.
* Don't sniff the network, no ssl-strip / rogue dhcp / random script-kiddo stuff. It's been done before. It's lame.
* Don't congest the network with (legal) torrenting, just behave nicely, so we don't have to write an AUP.

## How conflict gets resolved

If a conflict gets out of hand the board will be forced to resolve the issue.

* The board is the shepherd of the blueprint
* In case of conflict the first approach is to let the group work it out, if this fails or takes too long the board can step in and resolve the issue

Conflicts are inevitable in any group; the challenge is in resolving them. Unfortunately, there is no procedure that we can put in stone and guarantee that all conflicts are resolved to everybody's satisfaction. Instead, we have a simple rule: if you find yourself in a conflict, try to resolve it yourself. Perhaps you might have a Private Talk [insert link]. If this fails, perhaps find a mediator to help you resolve it.

However, if the conflict gets out of hand the board will be forced to resolve the issue. In this case, it must be a very serious issue indeed, and therefore the board will likely respond by temporarily banning one or both members involved, at their sole discretion. Obviously, this is not an outcome that anybody wants, so finding resolutions on your own will be key.
