# 7. Projects, property and space maintenance

There is a clear distinction between "personal" and "space" projects. Keep this in mind so you know what to expect and what people can expect of you.

## Personal projects
* You have full control over how to do the project.
* The project stuff/material is considered your personal property.
* You decide what happens to the end result of the project.

## Space projects
* The do-ocracy decides how to do the project.
* The project stuff/material is considered space property.
* The do-ocracy decides what happens to the end result of the project.

## Core projects
Some projects, particularly ones that affect core infrastructure or interface with the outside world, have weight to them. The board has graciously agreed to accept personal liability for the space, but in turn, the members have to share the responsibility of their actions with the board. Therefore, permission from the board is MANDATORY before working on financial and core infrastructure, such as the electrical system, the physical space, or the organization itself (e.g. sign contracts on behalf of the space). From time to time, the board may decide that your project is critical enough to have become core infrastructure. In this case, congratulations! You've made something people depend on. However, with that you need to make sure that your project will outlast you. Perhaps that means that the board needs access to the source code, or to know how to modify the project, or perhaps a domain name will need to be transferred to the space itself. If you're not comfortable with that sort of thing, then please don't work on that sort of project.

## Property and tools

### Personal property
* Only members are allowed to have personal property in the space. You get one box (the membership box) where you can leave your stuff. If you need more space for your projects, bring it up in a group meeting.
* If you break personal property of another member, you have to fully reimburse the member's losses.
* All personal property that is not in a members box has to be labeled (including tools and machines).

### Space property

#### Using space property
* When you are using tools/infrastructure from the space, you are effectively borrowing that item from the community.
* Return borrowed items as soon as possible in the same or better condition than when borrowed.
* So when using something, clean it afterwards and put it back in its place.
* If you are not trained to use tool X, don't use tool X but ask an expert to teach you first.
* If you use one of the public workstations, please shut it off when you are done.
* If you use the printer, please deposit some cash to pay for consumables.

#### Damaging or losing space property
If you damage or lose space property, you have to notify the community immediately in the Changelog or Main channel on mattermost. Explain what happened and if/how you will fix it.

#### Taking space property out of the space
Only members are allowed to take space property out of the space. If you take space property out of the space, you have to notify the community immediately, for example in the Changelog or Main channel on Mattermost. If someone disagrees with you taking it out of the space, make that person happy or put it back.

## Space maintenance

### Cleaning
* Keep the dishes clean: when using the dishes, clean your dishes and any dishes that are standing there. When you see other people using the dishes, and they forget cleaning them, give them a gentle reminder.
* Keep the desks clean, feel free to use the desk space for your stuff, you can leave your stuff on the desk when you just 'pop out for some food', but leave a note stating when you'll be back. Do Not leave it there until the next morning.
* Remove empty packaging, from food or beverages.
* Every once in a while there will be a cleaning day in the space, as a good upstanding member of the community you should attend one of these at least once quarterly. Many hands make light work.

### Exit space
* If you are the last person to leave the space, it's your responsibility to clean up. If you see people leaving, please alert them if they have left their trash in the space.
* Switch off all power consuming things
* Read and follow the checklist at the door.

### Throwing things away
* Some things that seem a useless waste of space to you might be very valuable to other people. When you throw things away, you have to let the community know and give them enough time to object.
