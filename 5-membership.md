# 5. Membership

## How do I become a member?

- Potential member joins mattermost
- Potential member visits the space and find two sponsors to broadcast their sponsorship on the @changelog channel.
- The new membership application is announced in ~Changelog, by a board member or a quicker member.
- If other members have objections, they may express them in @spacemembers during the 7 days following the board's announcement.
- At least 7 days after the announcement, the board schedules a meeting for the new member to be inducted.. If there were objections, the board makes a reasonable effort to ensure that those members can be present.
- At the announced meeting, two things occur:
  1. If there were objections, the members with objections have a chance to lay out their concerns. Other members may agree or disagree with these concerns. Then the potential member may speak in their defense, if they so desire. Then the board makes a decision on whether to accept the member
  2. The new member is granted full membership, they receive instructions on transferring their membership fees (and, of course, make their first payment), and receive physical access to the space

The board may decide that deviations from these steps are still acceptable.

## What are the responsibilities of a member?

The members create and maintain the hacker environment.

When a conflict/problem can not be resolved between individuals, via do-ocracy or when it impacts the group, a group decision is required. Any member can request that a decision is made on a meeting instead of by do-ocracy or individual members.

The members should do the following things as a group.
* Create and patch the hackerspace blueprint.
* Solve problems in the hackerspace when do-ocracy cannot fix them.
* Electing the board during a General Assembly.

The individuals have to be excellent.
* Organize workshops, events, lectures.
* Follow do-ocracy.
* Actively try to fix problems.
* Maintain personal safety and that of others. 
* Follow and enforce the Guidelines.

## Non-members

Non-members are also an important part of the space. They can contribute to the hacker environment and they can be potential members. However, non-members have less privileges than members.

* Non-members are only allowed in the space when they are in company of a member. That member is responsible for the actions of the non-member.
* Non-members have to follow the guidelines. A non-member is not allowed to challenge a decision made by the group. If the non-member disagree with a decision made by the group, then they should become a member and bring the topic forward on a meeting.
